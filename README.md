# Panel - Are Clinical Trials Ready for GenAI?

Roundtable from 11:15-12:30. Jeremy/Devin to do ~20 minute intro leading in to panel discussion. 

## Overview

- Objective: Provide a "State of the Union" for GenAI in Clinical Trials.
- Intro talk objectives:
   - Set up the question: Are Clinical trials ready for GenAI?
   - Discuss models (plateauing??) vs tooling (rapid evolution) (Both)
   - GenAI 101 providing baseline shared vocabulary  (Devin)
      - Context Engineering
      - Agents
      - RAG
      - MCP
  - Intro Clinical Trial Use cases
     - Consider ADaM example from Novo?
- There is a [Separate session on AI-Assisted Coding
](https://github.com/rinpharma/rinpharma-summit-2025/discussions/9) so we can mostly focus on "Pipelines" and discuss coding tools later in the afternoon.
