# Panel - Are Clinical Trials Ready for GenAI?

Roundtable from 11:15-12:30. Jeremy/Devin to do ~20 minute intro leading in to panel discussion. 

## Overview

- Objective: Provide a "State of the Union" for GenAI in Clinical Trials.
- Intro talk objectives:
   - Set up the question: Are Clinical trials ready for GenAI?
   - Discuss models (plateauing??) vs tooling (rapid evolution) (Both)
   - GenAI 101 providing baseline shared vocabulary  (Devin)
      - Context Engineering
      - Agents
      - RAG
      - MCP
  - Intro Clinical Trial Use cases
     - Consider ADaM example from Novo?
- There is a [Separate session on AI-Assisted Coding
](https://github.com/rinpharma/rinpharma-summit-2025/discussions/9) so we can mostly focus on "Pipelines" and discuss coding tools later in the afternoon.

## Panel Discussion

Panel discussion with: 
- Jeremy Wildfire (Gilead, Moderator) 
- Joe Cheng (Posit, Panelist)
- Devin Pastoor (A2AI, Panelist)
- Eric Nantz (Eli Lilly, Panelist)

Discussion topics: 

1. *Are we ready?* - Pre-requisites for using GenAI in Pharma? Biggest Roadblocks? 
2. *Lessons Learned* - Biggest Success stories to date? What works right now? What didnâ€™t work? Why? Lessons learned?
3. *Buy vs. Build* - Are there tools we should buy now? 
4. *Tooling and Pipelines* - Discuss emerging Human in the loop best practices. Discuss GitHub + Copilot integrations. Other Tooling? 
5. *GenAI as an analyst* - Analyzing data directly vs. Writing code to analyze data.
6. *Security Overview* - Risks of loading private data into public models. Prompt Injection 101.
7. *Regulatory Landscape* - How are regulators (FDA, EMA, PMDA, etc.) thinking about GenAI-use in trials: guidance, precedents, gaps?
8. *Prediction Time* - Where will we be in 5-10 years with linear growth in AI capabilities? What if growth really is exponential?
